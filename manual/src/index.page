This is a manual for hoe-manualgen. Hoe-manualgen is a plugin for Hoe, a Rake/Rubygems helper for project Rakefiles. It adds tasks for creating, rendering, and uploading a technical manual or cookbook for your project.

h3(#installation). Installation

You can install the plugin via Rubygems in the usual manner:

bc. $ sudo gem install hoe-manualgen

After it's installed, you can enable it in your Hoe-ified Rakefile for access to the manual-generation tasks:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Enable the 'manualgen' plugin in your Rakefile" } ?>
require 'hoe'

Hoe.plugin :manualgen

Hoe.spec 'my-project' do
	# ...
end
<?end?>	

h3(#rake-tasks). Rake Tasks

If you don't already have a manual for your project, the plugin only defines one task called @manual@, which will set up a basic manual directory structure in your project. You can execute it by running @rake manual@:

<?example {language: bash, caption: "Creating the manual directory-structure." } ?>
$ rake manual
(in /Users/jrandom/source/ruby/my-project)
Create a new manual directory tree from a template? [n] y
Generating manual skeleton
[...]
<?end?>

It creates a directory called 'manual' (by default) at the root of your project and copies some default resources, templates, and filters into it. It also generates a minimal index page for your new manual to get you started at @manual/src/index.page@. It looks something like this:

<?example { language: html, caption: "The initial index page."} ?>

With an existing manual directory structure, the @manual@ task will render the manual, so you can actually render the basic index page right after setting it up:

<?example { language: shell, caption: "Generating the manual." } ?>
$ rake manual:rebuild
(in /Users/mgranger/source/ruby/hoe-manualgen)
rm -f manual/output/index.html

<?end?>

As you can see, the task generates the API documentation, copies it into a subdirectory, then renders each @.page@ file it finds in the source directory as an HTML file. The API documentation is used by the API filter to auto-generate links from the manual to the appropriate spot in the documentation. The particulars are covered "a little later":#filters.


h3(#configuration). Configuration

You can configure various aspects of the manual by configuring it in the @Hoe.spec@ block. The supported configuration attributes are:

- @manual_template_dir@ := Set the directory which contains the template directory for creating new manuals. This is the directory used by the @manual@ task to create a manual from scratch, and also by the @manual:update@ task to update the static resources.
- @manual_base_dir@ := Set the base directory of the manual build. All the paths other than @manual_template_dir@ are relative to this directory unless they begin with @'/'@.
- @manual_source_dir@ := Set the directory which will contain the @.page@ source files. Defaults to @'src'@.
- @manual_layouts_dir@ := Set the directory which will contain the ERb layouts. Defaults to @'layouts'@.
- @manual_output_dir@ := Set the directory which will contain the rendered manual output. Defaults to @'output'@.
- @manual_resource_dir@ := Set the directory which will contain static resources that should be copied into the output directory. Defaults to @'resources'@.
- @manual_lib_dir@ := Set the directory which will contain Ruby filter libraries. Defaults to @'lib'@.
- @manual_metadata@ := An OpenStruct which can be used to inject metadata into page files. Plugins receive this as the third argument to their @#process@ method, and it's visible as a @metadata@ local variable inside layouts and the default ERb filter.


h3(#page-structure). Page Structure

Pages are structured as a file with a YAML header followed by a content section. The content is rendered via one or more plugins which are listed in the header, in the order they are specified.


h4(#page-structure-header). Header

The page header, as mentioned before, is used to set metadata values that control page order in the index, the page's title, which filters it will use to transform the page content, and other similar things.

- @title@ := Used in the HTML header, auto-generated indexes, and for referring to the page from other pages via the @<?link ?>@ tag.
- @filters@ := The filters that should be used to render the page content, in the order they should be run.

h4(#page-structure-content). Content

h3(#filters). Filters

h4(#filters-builtin). Built-in Filters

- @textile@ := Renders Textile markup as HTML. See <?api Hoe::ManualGen::TextileFilter ?> for details.
- @erb@ := Expands ERB tags. See <?api Hoe::ManualGen::ErbFilter ?> for details.


h4(#default-filters). Default Filter Plugins

- @api@ := Generate links to API documentation. See <?api Hoe::ManualGen::APIFilter ?> for details.
- @editorial@ := Insert editorial markup. See <?api Hoe::ManualGen::EditorialFilter ?> for details.
- @examples@ := Insert example code with syntax highlighting, optional XMP filtering, and captioning. See <?api Hoe::ManualGen::ExampleFilter ?> for details.
- @links@ := Insert automatically-generated links to other pages by page title or filename. See <?api Hoe::ManualGen::LinksFilter ?> for details.


h4(#filters-writing-your-own). Writing Your Own Filters

Filters should inherit from <?api Hoe::ManualGen::PageFilter ?>, and implement a public @#process@ method. See <?api Hoe::ManualGen::PageFilter ?> for more details on how to write your own.


h3(#customization). Customization

In addition to writing your own page filters, you can also customize your manual by replacing or adding ERB templates to the @layouts@ directory. Each layout should contain:

<?example { language: html, caption: Minimum layout template. } ?>
<%%= content %>
<?end?>

The page's content section will be filtered through all of its configured filters, and then set as the @content@ local variable before the layout is rendered.
