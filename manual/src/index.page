This is a manual for hoe-manualgen. Hoe-manualgen is a plugin for Hoe, a Rake/Rubygems helper for project Rakefiles. It adds tasks for creating, rendering, and uploading a technical manual or cookbook for your project.

h3(#installation). Installation

You can install the plugin via Rubygems in the usual manner:

	$ sudo gem install hoe-manualgen

After it's installed, you can enable it in your Hoe-ified Rakefile for access to the manual-generation tasks:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Enable the 'manualgen' plugin in your Rakefile" } ?>
require 'hoe'

Hoe.plugin :manualgen

Hoe.spec 'my-project' do
	# ...
end
<?end?>	

h3(#rake-tasks). Rake Tasks

The plugin only defines one task called @manual@ at first, which will set up a basic manual directory structure in your project. You can execute it by running @rake manual@:

<?example {language: bash, caption: "Creating the manual directory-structure." } ?>
$ rake manual

It creates a directory called 'manual' (by default) at the root of your project and copies some default resources, templates, and filters into it. It also generates a minimal index page for your new manual to get you started at @manual/src/index.page@. It looks something like this:

<?example { language: html, caption: "The initial index page."} ?>

With an existing manual directory structure, the @manual@ task will render the manual, so you can actually render the basic index page right after setting it up:

<?example { language: shell, caption: "Generating the manual." } ?>
$ rake manual
(in /Users/jrandom/source/ruby/my-project)
Copying manual resources
[info]: Re-generating object MyProject::Server...
[info]: Re-generating object MyProject::Authentication...
[info]: Re-generating object MyProject::User...
[info]: Re-generating object MyProject...
[info]: Re-generating object ...
Files:           4
Modules:         2 (    0 undocumented)
Classes:         2 (    1 undocumented)
Constants:      17 (    1 undocumented)
Methods:        25 (    0 undocumented)
 95.65% documented
cp -r doc manual/output/api
  manual/src/index.page -> manual/output/index.html
<?end?>

As you can see, the task renders each @.page@ file it finds in the source directory as an HTML file, and copies the API documentation generated by RDoc into a subdirectory. This is used by the API filter to auto-generate links from the manual to the appropriate spot in the documentation. The particulars are covered "a little later":#filters.


h3(#configuration). Configuration

h3(#page-structure). Page Structure

h4(#page-structure-header). Header

The page header, as mentioned before, is used to set metadata values that control page order in the index, the page's title, which filters it will use to transform the page content, and other similar things.

- @title@ := Used in the HTML header, auto-generated indexes, and for referring to the page from other pages via the @<?link ?>@ tag.
- @filters@ := The filters that should be used to render the page content, in the order they should be run.
